# About JVI
Java Virtualization Interface (JVI) is the open-source, pure-Java API for the Waratek J-Hypervisor, a Java Virtual Machine Monitor (Java VMM).  The Waratek Java VMM is highly configurable and designed to be embeddable into different JVMs. 
 
The JVI is a compact programming framework for interacting with the Java VMM and defining arbitrary virtualization schemes for any type (class) of the Java Platform, as well as any third-party applications and programming frameworks.  JVI is designed to be easy to use and readily configurable for sophisticated Java virtualization schemes.  It is unique in being designed to facilitate virtualization of any Java Platform framework or application with no code change.
